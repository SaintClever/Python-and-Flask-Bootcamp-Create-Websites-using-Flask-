Hey there! Here is a reference of the commands for using the Command Line on
a Mac OS or Linux Computer. Keep in mind, these are just the most basic commands
that you should know, there are a lot more commands than just these.

----------------------------
--- Changing Directory -----
----------------------------

Use cd to change directory. So for example, if you are in the main folder for
all the notes and you saved them to your downloads folder and you wanted to
change into this directory, it would look like this:

Joses-Macbook-Pro:~ Jose:  cd Desktop

would then result in:

My-MacBook-Pro:Desktop Jose$

Remember that you can usually use the Tab button on your keyboard to
auto-complete file paths!

Need to go back up a folder? That's easy its just cd followed by two periods/dots:

My-MacBook-Pro:Desktop Jose$ cd ..

would then result in:

My-Macbook-Pro:~ Jose:

-----------------------------------------
--- Displaying your Current Directory ---
-----------------------------------------

For most terminals you should usually be able to see your directory
directly to the left of your cursor, but in case you have any doubt just use
pwd by itself to print your working directory:


Joses-Macbook-Pro:~ Jose: pwd

would then result in:

/Users/Jose

--------------------------------------------------------
--- Listing all the Folders in the Current Directory ---
--------------------------------------------------------

You can use ls to list all the files and folders in the current directory:

My-MacBook-Pro:Downloads Jose$ ls

This would then result in an output of all files and folders inside the
Downloads folder.

----------------------------
--- Clearing the Screen ----
----------------------------

You can use clear to clear the command prompt screen. You can always press up on
the arrow key to get back older commands (although you can't undo commands)
