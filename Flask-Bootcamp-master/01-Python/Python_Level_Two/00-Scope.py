# Nested Statements and Scope #
###############################

# Now that we have gone over on writing our own functions, its important to
# understand how Python deals with the variable names you assign. When you create
# a variable name in Python the name is stored in a *name-space*. Variable names
# also have a "scope", the scope determines the visibility of that variable name
# to other parts of your code.
#
# Lets start with a quick thought experiment, imagine the following code:

x = 25

def printer():
    x = 50
    return x

print(x)
print(printer())


# What do you imagine the output of printer() is? 25 or 50? What is the output
# of print x? 25 or 50? Or what about this:

print(x)
print(printer())
print(x)


# Interesting! But how does Python know which "x" you're referring to in your
# code? This is where the idea of scope comes in. Python has a set of rules it
# follows to decide what variables (such as x in this case) you are referencing
# in your code. Lets break down the rules:

# This idea of scope in your code is very important to understand in order to
# properly assign and call variable names.
#
# In simple terms, the idea of scope can be described by 3 general rules:
#
# 1. Name assignments will create or change local names by default.
# 2. Name references search (at most) four scopes, these are:
#     * local
#     * enclosing functions
#     * global
#     * built-in
# 3. Names declared in global and nonlocal statements map assigned names to
# enclosing module and function scopes.
#
#
# The statement in #2 above can be defined by the LEGB rule.
#
# **LEGB Rule.**
#
# L: Local — Names assigned in any way within a function (def or lambda)),
# and not declared global in that function.
#
# E: Enclosing function locals — Name in the local scope of any and all
# enclosing functions (def or lambda), from inner to outer.
#
# G: Global (module) — Names assigned at the top-level of a module file, or
# declared global in a def within the file.
#
# B: Built-in (Python) — Names preassigned in the built-in names module :
# open,range,SyntaxError,...

###############################
### Quick examples of LEGB ####
###############################

# Local

# x is local here:
f = lambda x:x**2


# Enclosing function locals
#
# This occurs when we have a function inside a function (nested functions)
#

name = 'This is a global name'

def greet():
    # Enclosing function
    name = 'Sammy'

    def hello():
        print('Hello '+name)

    hello()

greet()


# Note how Sammy was used, because the hello() function was enclosed inside of
# the greet function!

# Global
#
print(name)





# Local Variables

# When you declare variables inside a function definition, they are not related
# in any way to other variables with the same names used outside the function -
# i.e. variable names are local to the function. This is called the scope of the
# variable. All variables have the scope of the block they are declared in
# starting from the point of definition of the name.
#
# Example:

x = 50

def func(x):
    print('x is', x)
    x = 2
    print('Changed local x to', x)

func(x)
print('x is still', x)


# The first time that we print the value of the name x with the first line in
# the function’s body, Python uses the value of the parameter declared in the
# main block, above the function definition.
#
# Next, we assign the value 2 to x. The name x is local to our function. So,
# when we change the value of x in the function, the x defined in the main block
# remains unaffected.
#
# With the last print statement, we display the value of x as defined in the main
# block, thereby confirming that it is actually unaffected by the local
# assignment within the previously called function.

################################
# The Global Statement
################################

# If you want to assign a value to a name defined at the top level of the program
# (i.e. not inside any kind of scope such as functions or classes), then you have
# to tell Python that the name is not local, but it is global. We do this using
# the global statement. It is impossible to assign a value to a variable defined
# outside a function without the global statement.
#
# You can use the values of such variables defined outside the function
# (assuming there is no variable with the same name within the function).
# However, this is not encouraged and should be avoided since it becomes unclear
# to the reader of the program as to where that variable’s definition is. Using
# the global statement makes it amply clear that the variable is defined
# in an outermost block.
#
# Example:

x = 50

def func():
    global x
    print('This function is now using the global x!')
    print(f'Because of global x is: {x}')
    x = 2
    print(f'Ran func(), changed global x to {x}')

print(f'Before calling func(), x is: {x}')
func()
print(f'Value of x (outside of func()) is: {x}')


# The global statement is used to declare that x is a global variable - hence,
# when we assign a value to x inside the function, that change is reflected
# when we use the value of x in the main block.
#
# You can specify more than one global variable using the same global statement
# e.g. global x, y, z.

###############################
# Conclusion
###############################

# You should now have a good understanding of Scope (you may have already
# intuitively felt right about Scope which is great!) One last mention is that
# you can use the globals() and locals() functions to check what are your current
# local and global variables.
#
# Another thing to keep in mind is that everything in Python is an object! I can
# assign variables to functions just like I can with numbers! We will go over
# this again in the decorator section of the course!
