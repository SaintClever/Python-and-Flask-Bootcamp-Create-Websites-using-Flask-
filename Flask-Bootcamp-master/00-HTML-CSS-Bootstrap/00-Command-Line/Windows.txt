Hey there! Here is a reference of the commands for using the Command Line on
a Windows PC. Keep in mind, these are just the most basic commands that you
should know, there are a lot more commands than just these.

----------------------------
--- Changing Directory -----
----------------------------

Use cd to change directory. So for example, if you are in the main folder for
all the notes and you saved them to your downloads folder and you wanted to
change into this directory, it would look like this:

C:/Users/Jose/Downloads  cd Commands_Line_Crash_Course

would then result in:

C:/Users/Jose/Downloads/Commands_Line_Crash_Course

Remember that you can usually use the Tab button on your keyboard to
auto-complete file paths!

Need to go back up a folder? That's easy its just cd followed by two periods/dots:

C:/Users/Jose/Downloads/Commands_Line_Crash_Course cd ..

would then result in:

C:/Users/Jose/Downloads/

-----------------------------------------
--- Displaying your Current Directory ---
-----------------------------------------

For most Windows Command prompt you should usually be able to see your directory
directly to the left of your cursor, but in case you have any doubt just use
cd by itself to report back the current directory:


C:/Users/Jose/Downloads/ cd

would then result in:

C:/Users/Jose/Downloads/

--------------------------------------------------------
--- Listing all the Folders in the Current Directory ---
--------------------------------------------------------

You can use dir to list all the files and folders in the current directory:

C:/Users/Jose/Downloads/ dir

This would then result in an output of all files and folders inside the
Downloads folder.

----------------------------
--- Clearing the Screen ----
----------------------------

You can use cls to clear the command prompt screen. You can always press up on
the arrow key to get back older commands (although you can't undo commands)
