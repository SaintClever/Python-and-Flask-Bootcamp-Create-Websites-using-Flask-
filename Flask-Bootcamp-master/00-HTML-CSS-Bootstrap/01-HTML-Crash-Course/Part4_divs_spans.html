    <!--  Using a div tag will group elements together in a division-->
    <!--  It is a generic container (block-level)-->
    <!--  Later on we will see the application for this-->
    <!--  It will become very useful with CSS -->
    <!--  Things applied to this div container will effect everything in it-->

    <!-- A CSS class will eventually go here -->
    <div class="">

      <h1>Some Header that I want to group with</h1>
        <p>
          Some text that I want to be grouped
          with the header above!
        </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      You can use a span: <span> inside of the span</span>
      This works as a in-line container that only effect something in-line!
