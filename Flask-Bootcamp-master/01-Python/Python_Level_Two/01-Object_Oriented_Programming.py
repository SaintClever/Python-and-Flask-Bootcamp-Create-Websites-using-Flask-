# # Object Oriented Programming
###############################

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) tends to be one of the major obstacles for
# beginners when they are first starting to learn Python.
#
# There are many,many tutorials and lessons covering OOP so feel free to Google
# search other lessons, and I have also put some links to other useful tutorials
# online at the bottom of this Notebook.
#
# For this lesson we will construct our knowledge of OOP in Python by building
# on the following topics:
#
# * Objects
# * Using the *class* keyword
# * Creating class attributes
# * Creating methods in a class
# * Learning about Inheritance
# * Learning about Special Methods for classes
#
# Lets start the lesson by remembering about the Basic Python Objects.
# For example:
mylist = [1,2,3]


# Remember how we could call methods on a list?
mylist.count(2)


# What we will basically be doing in this lecture is exploring how we could
# create an Object type like a list. We've already learned about how to create
# functions. So lets explore Objects in general:
#

###################
#  Objects
###################
# In Python, *everything is an object*. Remember from previous lectures we can
# use type() to check the type of object something is:


print(type(1))
print(type([1,2,3]))
print(type((1,2,3)))
print(type({'key1':100}))


# So we know all these things are objects, so how can we create our own Object
#  types? That is where the *class* keyword comes in.

###################
# Class
###################

# The user defined objects are created using the class keyword. The class is a
# blueprint that defines a nature of a future object. From classes we can
# construct instances. An instance is a specific object created from a particular
# class.

# For example, above we created the object 'l' which was an instance of a list object.
#
# Let see how we can use **class**:


# Create a new object type called Sample
class Sample():
    pass

# Instance of Sample
x = Sample()

print(type(x))


# By convention we give classes a name that starts with a capital letter.
# Note how x is now the reference to our new instance of a Sample class.
# In other words, we **instantiate** the Sample class.
#
# Inside of the class we currently just have pass.
#  But we can define class attributes and methods.
#
# An **attribute** is a characteristic of an object.
# A **method** is an operation we can perform with the object.
#
# For example we can create a class called Dog. An attribute of a dog may be its
# breed or its name, while a method of a dog may be defined by a .bark() method
# which returns a sound.
#
# Let's get a better understanding of attributes through an example.
#

###################
# Attributes
###################

# The syntax for creating an attribute is:
#
#     self.attribute = something
#
# There is a special method called:
#
#     __init__()
#
# This method is used to initialize the attributes of an object. For example:


class Dog():
    def __init__(self,breed):
        self.breed = breed

sam = Dog(breed='Lab')
frank = Dog(breed='Huskie')


# Lets break down what we have above.The special method
#
#     __init__()
# is called automatically right after the object has been created:
#
#     def __init__(self, breed):
# Each attribute in a class definition begins with a reference to the instance
# object. It is by convention named self. The breed is the argument. The value
# is passed during the class instantiation.
#
#      self.breed = breed

# Now we have created two instances of the Dog class. With two breed types, we
# can then access these attributes like this:

sam.breed

frank.breed


# Note how we don't have any parenthesis after breed, this is because it is an
# attribute and doesn't take any arguments.
#
# In Python there are also *class object attributes*. These Class Object
# Attributes are the same for any instance of the class. For example, we could
# create the attribute *species* for the Dog class. Dogs regardless of their
# breed,name, or other attributes will always be mammals.
# We apply this logic in the following manner:

class Dog():

    # Class Object Attribute
    species = 'mammal'

    def __init__(self,breed,name):
        self.breed = breed
        self.name = name

sam = Dog('Lab','Sam')

sam.name


# Note that the Class Object Attribute is defined outside of any methods in the
# class. Also by convention, we place them first before the init.

sam.species

###################
# Methods
###################

# Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to
# perform operations with the attributes of our objects. Methods are essential
# in encapsulation concept of the OOP paradigm. This is essential in dividing
# responsibilities in programming, especially in large applications.
#
# You can basically think of methods as functions acting on an Object that take
# the Object itself into account through its *self* argument.
#
# Lets go through an example of creating a Circle class:

class Circle():

    # This is a Class Object Attribute
    # Notice how it is not under __init__
    pi = 3.14

    # Circle get instantiated with a radius (default is 1)
    def __init__(self, radius=1):
        self.radius = radius

    # Area method calculates the area. Note the use of self.
    def area(self):
        return self.radius * self.radius * Circle.pi

    # Method for resetting Radius
    def setRadius(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    # Method for getting radius (Same as just calling .radius)
    def getRadius(self):
        return self.radius


c = Circle()

c.setRadius(2)
print('Radius is: ')
print(c.getRadius())
print('Area is: ')
print(c.area())


# Great! Notice how we used self. notation to reference attributes of the class
# within the method calls. Review how the code above works and try creating your own method
#

###################
# Inheritance
###################

# Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already
# been defined. The newly formed classes are called derived classes, the classes
# that we derive from are called base classes. Important benefits of inheritance
# are code reuse and reduction of complexity of a program. The derived classes
# (descendants) override or extend the functionality of base classes (ancestors).
#
# Lets see an example by incorporating our previous work on the Dog class:


class Animal():
    def __init__(self):
        print("Animal created")

    def report(self):
        print("Animal")

    def eat(self):
        print("Eating")


class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
        # Animal.__init__(self)
        print("Dog created")

    def report(self):
        print("Dog")

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

d = Dog()
d.report()
d.eat()
d.bark()


# In this example, we have two classes: Animal and Dog. The Animal is the base
# class, the Dog is the derived class.
#
# The derived class inherits the functionality of the base class.
#
# * It is shown by the eat() method.
#
# The derived class modifies existing behavior of the base class.
#
# * shown by the report() method.
#
# Finally, the derived class extends the functionality of the base class,
# by defining a new bark() method.

# Special Methods

class Book():
    def __init__(self, title, author, pages):
        print("A book is created")
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.pages = pages

    def __repr__(self):
        # Notice how this is return, NOT print()
        return f"Title:{self.title} , author:{self.author}, pages:{self.pages}"

    def __len__(self):
        return self.pages


book = Book("Python Rocks!", "Jose Portilla", 159)

#Special Methods
