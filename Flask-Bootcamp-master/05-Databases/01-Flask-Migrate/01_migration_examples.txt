Okay, we just learned the basics of migration commands. Let's now go through a
more realistic example. First let's add a column in our model.

Go back to the models .py file and add a puppy breed column.

Then make a migration script ( a pending migration) with the migrate command.

flask db migrate -m "added breed column"

Now upgrade the database to effect the changes.

flask db upgrade
