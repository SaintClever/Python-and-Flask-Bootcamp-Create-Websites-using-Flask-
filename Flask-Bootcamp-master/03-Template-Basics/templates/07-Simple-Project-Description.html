Hi there! Check the video for full details of this project.

You should have 3 html files:

1. The base.html to extend to. This html file should have a simple navbar
2. The index home page should have the form for the user name and
it should describe the requirements.
3. Then you should have a redirect after the form is filled that
reports back if the username passed the requirements.
